![Project Banner](proj_1.png)

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project analyzes Target's operations in Brazil, focusing on 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018. Using BigQuery SQL, we dive deep into various aspects of the business, including order status, pricing, payment and freight performance, customer location, product attributes, and customer reviews.

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **📅 Time Range**: Orders span from April 9th, 2016, to October 17th, 2018 (2 years, 25 months, 773 days).
2. **🌎 Geographic Reach**: Customers from 27 distinct states and 4,119 unique cities.
3. **📈 Order Trends**: Consistent upward trajectory in order volume throughout the year.
4. **🕒 Peak Order Times**: Brazilian customers tend to place more orders during the afternoon.
5. **💰 Economic Impact**: 137% growth rate in order value from 2017 to 2018 (Jan-Aug).
6. **🚚 Delivery Performance**: Average delivery time is 12 days, with potential for improvement.
